              are approximate only and the Seller shall not be liable for any

              shall not be of the essence unless previously agreed by the Seller
              in Writing. The Goods may be delivered by the Seller in advance of
              the quoted delivery date upon giving reasonable notice to the
              Buyer.

              Seller does not accept responsibility for defects resulting from
              the location in which the Goods are to be used, or for their
              method of use, nor for any failure to correspond with any
              specification where that results from a failure to use the Goods
              in a suitable location.

              <strong>13.11.</strong> Any claim by the Buyer which is based on

              delivery is refused by the Buyer) be notified to the Seller in
              Writing within 4 days from the date of delivery. If delivery is
              not refused, and the Buyer does not notify the Seller accordingly,
              the Buyer shall not be entitled to reject the Goods and the Seller
              shall have no liability for such defect or failure, and the Buyer
              shall be bound to pay the price as if the Goods had been delivered
              in accordance with the Contract.

              <strong>13.12.</strong> Where any valid claim in respect of any of
              the Goods which is based on any defect in the quality or condition
              of the Goods or their failure to meet specification is notified to
              the Seller in accordance with these Conditions, the Seller shall
              be entitled to replace the Goods (or the part in question) free of
              charge or, at the Seller's sole discretion refund to the Buyer the
              price of the Goods (or a proportionate part of the price) but the
              Seller shall have no further liability to the Buyer. It is a
              condition of any alleged claim made by the Buyer that the Goods
              must be returned to the Seller within seven days of the claim
              being notified to the Seller quoting a valid returns number
              failing which the Buyer shall be bound to pay the price as if the
              Goods had been delivered in accordance with the Contract or if the
              price has already been paid to the Seller shall be deemed to have
              supplied the Goods in accordance with the Contract.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br /> <strong>13.13.</strong>Except in respect of death or
              personal injury caused by the Seller's negligence the Seller shall
              not be liable to the Buyer by reason of any implied warranty,
              condition or other term, or any duty at common law, or under the
              express terms of the Contract, for any consequential loss or
              damage (whether for loss of profit or otherwise), costs, expenses
              or any other claims for consequential compensation whatsoever (and
              whether caused by the negligence of the Seller, its employees or
              agents or otherwise) which arise out of or in connection with the
              supply of the Goods or their use or resale by the Buyer, except as
              to a figure which equates to the sale price to the Goods in this
              Contract and where the alleged consequential loss or damage arises
              in relation to a single item out of the Goods limited always to
              the sale price in this Contract of that individual item. The Buyer
              recognises that the limitation of liability contained herein is
              reasonable and that the prices quoted by the Seller are dependent
              upon such limitation being incorporated into the Contract.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>13.14.</strong> Not withstanding delivery and the passing
              of risk in the Goods, or any other provision of these Conditions,
              the property in the Goods shall not pass to the Buyer until the
              Seller has received in cash or cleared funds payment in full of
              the price of the Goods and all other Goods sold or agreed to be
              sold by the Seller to the Buyer, including Goods for which payment
              has not already fallen due.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br /> <strong>13.15.</strong> Any claim by the Buyer which is
              based on a shortfall in the number of Goods delivered shall
              (whether or not delivery is refused) be notified to the Seller in
              writing within 48 hours from the time of delivery. Where the Buyer
              fails to notify the Seller accordingly, the Seller shall be deemed
              to have supplied the Goods in accordance with the quantities
              specified in the Contract, and shall have no liability to the
              Buyer in respect of any such shortfall claim.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br /> <strong>13.16.</strong> If the Goods are damaged on
              delivery, then unless the Buyer notifies the Seller in writing
              within 3 days of delivery no claim against the company may be made
              in respect of damage of such Goods.
              <br />

              <br /> <br /> <strong>SECTION 15 - SEVERABILITY</strong> <br /> In
              the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is
              determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision
              shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted
              by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed
              to be severed from these Terms of Service, such determination
              shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other
              remaining provisions. <br /> <br />{" "}
              <strong>SECTION 16 - TERMINATION</strong> <br /> The obligations
              and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the termination
              date shall survive the termination of this agreement for all
              purposes. <br /> These Terms of Service are effective unless and
              until terminated by either you or us. You may terminate these
              Terms of Service at any time by notifying us that you no longer
              wish to use our Services, or when you cease using our site. <br />{" "}
              If in our sole judgment you fail, or we suspect that you have
              failed, to comply with any term or provision of these Terms of
              Service, we also may terminate this agreement at any time without
              notice and you will remain liable for all amounts due up to and
              including the date of termination; and/or accordingly may deny you
              access to our Services (or any part thereof). <br /> <br />{" "}
              <strong>SECTION 17 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT</strong> <br /> The failure
              of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms
              of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
              provision. <br /> These Terms of Service and any policies or
              operating rules posted by us on this site or in respect to The
              Service constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between
              you and us and govern your use of the Service, superseding any
              prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications and proposals,
              whether oral or written, between you and us (including, but not
              limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service). <br />{" "}
              Any ambiguities in the interpretation of these Terms of Service
              shall not be construed against the drafting party.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to
              another organisation. We will always tell you in writing if this
              happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your
              rights under the contract. If you are unhappy with the transfer
              you may contact us to end the contract within 10 days of us
              telling you about it and we will refund you any payments you have
              made in advance for products not provided.
              <br /> Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately.
              If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are
              unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and
              effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are
              required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps
              against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will
              not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not
              prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. For example,
              if you miss a payment and we do not chase you but we continue to
              provide the products, we can still require you to make the payment
              at a later date.
