              If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the right to object to
              processing based solely on automated decision-making (which
              includes profiling), when that decision-making has a legal effect
              on you or otherwise significantly affects you.

            <p>
              We do not engage in fully automated decision-making that has a
              legal or otherwise significant effect using customer data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our processor Shopify uses limited automated decision-making to
              prevent fraud that does not have a legal or otherwise significant
              effect on you.

              The length of time that a cookie remains on your computer or
              mobile device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session”
              cookie. Session cookies last until you stop browsing and
              persistent cookies last until they expire or are deleted. Most of
              the cookies we use are persistent and will expire between 30
              minutes and two years from the date they are downloaded to your
              device.
